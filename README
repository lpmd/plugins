lpmd-plugins package
====================
====================

Thise package provide the source files of a plugin set, distributed with
the lpmd package.

The plugins are fundamental to use in simulations of molecular dynamics as 
well in analysis of results. For more information about how lpmd is divided
and why, visit the website http://www.lpmd.cl/modularity

The plugins packages are divided in ten main categories :

1) In/Out
2) Cell Generators
3) Cell Managers
4) Filters
5) Modifiers
6) Visualizers
7) Potentials
8) Integrators
9) Temporal Properties
10) Instantaneous Properties

In/Out
------

These are the plugins that control the load of external file load and save process. 
For example xyz, lpmd, pdb, etc.

Cell Generators
---------------

These plugins build structures from a set of specific instruction. An example of these 
are crystal (to build fcc, bcc, hcp, and sc structures), voronoi, etc.

Cell Managers
-------------

Cell Managers are an specific set of plugins that can control how the simulation cell 
is divided during the execution of lpmd. Examples of these plugins are minimumimage, 
linkedcell, binarycell, etc.

Filters
-------

Filters are a set of plugins that allow us to 'filter' a specific set of atoms. The
highlight use is mainly during analysis process. Some examples of these plugins are
box, etc.

Modifiers
---------

This plugins allow us to modify the simulation cell during the execution. It is
possible modify not only atoms but cell structure also. Examples of these plugins are
.

Visualizers
-----------
Potentials
----------
Integrators
-----------
Temporal Properties
-------------------
Instantaneous Properties
------------------------
